# Marketing-email
A Python package to send HTML based emails at large quantities, without letting your emails considering as spams.
**Currently at development stage. Trying to add it as a PyPI Package.**
<br>
Just replace `email/index.html` with any of your customized html code and edit your receiver's email list
in the `email/send_email.py`. Then just run the python file and enter your email password.
